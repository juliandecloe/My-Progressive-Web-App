## Client-side vs Server-side

### Client-side
Client-side is the side of the website that the user (client) has acces to. A client-side website normally contains static HTML, CSS and Javascript. The benefits of client-side scripts is that you have acces to the DOM. So you can fully controll almost everything the user does and use everything what the client browser offers.

### Server-side
Server-side is the side of the website that the user (client) can't control or has acces to. The down part is that you also can't controll what the user does and what the client browser offers. Server-side scripts process information on the web server when the user requests this information. The benefits of server-side is that it can load scripts before the web page is loaded. This gives you the opportunity to make login systems and cache some important files so that the page performance is good and the user can even use your website offline.
